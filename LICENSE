We did consider providing under a GPL licence, but I think some more subtle
caveats are sensible. So basically this is GPL with a few extra caveats...

1. This is provided on basis of no warranty, same wording as GPL for that
   so copying only permitted on basis that you cannot hold the author(s),
   host(s), or sponsor(s), liable for any loss or damages in any way.

2. This is run as a free service on https://notsco.co.uk/ but we understand
   that some companies will want to keep everything in house. If you plan
   to use this for testing your own systems, you are welcome to do so,
   free of charge.*

3. If you want to run a free service using this, you also can do so free
   of charge* but there is not a lot of point as we provide it at
   https://notsco.co.uk/

4. If you plan to use this to provide a charged for service, or one with
   advertising, then no. You may not make any copy of this for that purpose.
   The whole idea is to make this freely available for CPs.

5. Finally, if you are TOTSCO, you need to talk to us and agree terms.
   TOTSCO running this as an official service would be an ideal outcome,
   and we will help with that, including shutting down https://notsco.co.uk/
   and setting up a redirect as well. But paying something for the
   development would be nice, and some agreement over ongoing maintenance.

* All we ask is that if you find anything that needs changing, especially
  if in some way we are not meeting the spec, you provide feedback, or
  better, a pull request, so all can benefit from what you have found.
